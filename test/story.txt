I used to struggle with grasping new concepts. So, over the past three years, 
I have compiled thousands of notes from books, YouTube videos, podcasts, articles, 
and speeches on the topic of learning.

I have used what I learned to create systems and tricks that have helped me boost 
my comprehension to unforeseen levels.

This is part 4 of the series on my top findings on how to learn efficiently and effectively.
Yeah yeah, I know you donâ€™t want to.

I mean, you need to always be reachable, right? In case an emergency happens?

Well, it is important to realize that if there is an emergency, there are other ways 
to reach you. Checking your email 50 times a day is not healthy, and creates context 
switches when doing real work, that make it hard for you to get back and stay focused.

When learning a new task, these distractions break down the connections you are making 
in your brain as you learn, making it harder to form new skills.

So, schedule how many times you will check your email throughout the day, and only 
do so on your laptop. Keep it off of your phone, and turn off any push notifications.
